# el-wire-costumes

A set of light up dance costumes were created for a private client. The light-up effect was implemented using EL wire. The costumes could be controlled remotely by using DMX512 as the communication protocol. An Arduino Uno, Arduino DMX512 shield, and Donner wireless DMX512 receivers/transmitter were used to connect the wiring to a remote lighting control board.
